## Abstract/Brief Description about the Project :
We have a data which classified if patients have heart disease or not according to features in it. We will try to use this data to create a model which tries predict if a patient has this disease or not. We will use multiple algorithms and the will decide the best algorithm that fits to the data.

I have also tried logistic Regression from scratch which shows pretty good results and then I have tried the inbuilt sklearn algorithms.

## Dataset :
The dataset which is used here, is collected from Kaggle website. 

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction

## Goal/Aim of the project :
The goal of this project is to analyse if the patient is suffering from any heart problem and build a classification model accordingly.
